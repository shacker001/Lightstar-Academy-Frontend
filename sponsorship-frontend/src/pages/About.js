            Education is not free in many parts of Africa, making it difficult for families to send their children to school.  
            Lightstar Academy was established to bridge this gap and provide quality education to children in need.

        <div className="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-8">
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">
            Indangalasia Lightstar Academy was founded in <strong>January 2014</strong> to help
            children from remote areas in Western Kenya, particularly in Kakamega County,
            Matungu Sub-county, and Indangalasia Sub-location.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mt-4">
            The school was established by <strong>Pastor Michael Otsieno Wanzala</strong> of
            Ambassadors of the Living Christ Sanctuary Ministry in Kenya. His vision was to
            support children who cannot afford expensive schools.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mt-4">
            However, the school faces several challenges, including a lack of facilities, limited meals, and difficulty in paying teachers' salaries.
